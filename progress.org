***** TODO Defining Overall transformation


      I have figured out the type that's needed for being able to do the transformation with proj, and I have defined some "recursor" functions accordingly, which does this only for proj_pair_left. However, for some reason LEAN can't figure out that it's terminating, even though I call recursor exactly once on a structurally smaller argument.

      Since I'm skipping transformations with Int for now, I'm going to move on with trying to do the termination proof.
***** TODO Proving Termination
      Unfold is not working on eqAdyProofTransform, I have no idea why. I feel like this might be related to the termination errors, but I'm not sure. (LEAN4 isn't able to prove termination for eqAdyProofTransform itself, which is strange).
**** TODO Proving its Correctness (/ proving correctness using it)
*** TODO Proving Subterm Property
